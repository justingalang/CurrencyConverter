I solved the problem I was having yesterday by changing the sign from '=' to '=>'. I set up my working project with git and renamed some files. The screen navigation so far makes a lot of sense. I am still not familiar with a lot of the JS syntax but I think I'll be able to use it in the future. Even copying and pasting some of the files will help a lot in future projects.

It feels like I was stuck on finding out why my FlatList wasn't showing my items. Finally, however, I realized that the tutorial and I had two different names for their RowItem text.
