* Started @ beginning 
* Stopped @ Module 4, Building a Custom Input Component


_Notes_
- File Tree organization
- Component creation (rowItem & rowseparator)
- Image Quality
- Text input Styling

_Stuck_
- home.js (45:7) - "text not defined"

_Questions_
- What is the naming practice for files? (home.js vs Home.js)

I started the modules today around 8:30pm and grinded it all out until now. In them we worked on 2 screens
- Options
- Home

The options screen consisted of making a table view. It was easy and creating the rowItem component was very interesting. 

The Home screen consisted of placing images. One thing I found cool is that React will pick the best quality from the images you provided. We had to center it and make it look nice. The text input on the Home screen was pretty cool and I was able to make something look pretty good in just a short amount of work. I should pay more attention to the styling and figure out how exactly I made the text boxes look like that. 

I am currently stuck on an error that is occuring in home.js "text not defined". Cross checked it with his code  and it looks fine so hopefully it will make more sense to me next time I look at it.

One thing I want to remember for future projects is the file tree organization - it makes a lot of sense to me and is something I want to incorporate in future systems.
